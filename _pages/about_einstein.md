I am a fourth year PhD student in Algebraic Geometry. My research interests lie in Arithmetic Geometry, Unlikely Intersections and Derived Categories. Currently I am looking at Fourier-Mukai partners of cubic fourfolds in a given Hassett divisor, and the geometry of Calabi-Yau varieties over finite fields. My advisors are [Christian BÃ¶hning](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/boehning/) opens in a new window and [Gavin Brown](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/brown/) opens in a new window. Before joining Warwick I completed an MMath at Trinity College, Oxford.
